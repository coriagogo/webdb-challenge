1. Explain the difference between `RDBMS` and `SQL`.

RDBMS is the actual db software. SQL is the language we use to query through the RDBMS.

2. Why do tables need a `primary key`?

A primary key allows us to specifically identify each table row.


3. What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table.

Foreign key.

4. What do we need in order to have a _many to many_ relationship between two tables.

We need a third table that contains the foreign keys to each table.
